# QUICKSTART


The next sections guide you through the minimum, fastest steps to participate in geoconnex assuming all you have is a collection of static geospatial files representing locations or areas you have data about. It includes instructions on how to interact with geoconnex.us services through GitHub, install open-source software (pygeoapi) available on GitHub, and deploy this software on the internet (using Google Cloud Platform as an example). This quickstart assumes that you have would like to publish a dataset you have available that in some way represents geospatial locations that have data related to water about them. Typical examples could be water quality monitoring sites, wells, streamgages, water utilities, weather stations, dams, and so on. 

By following these steps, you will be able quickly publish [landing pages](https://docs.geoconnex.us/principles/lc.html) with [embedded JSON-LD](https://docs.geoconnex.us/principles/jsonld.html) about each [feature](https://docs.geoconnex.us/principles/hydrofeatures.html) you have data about, and register [persistent identifiers](https://docs.geoconnex.us/principles/pids.html) them, allowing them to be harvested into the [knowledge graph](https://docs.geoconnex.us/content/intro.html).
