    "# General Principles\n",
    "\n",
    "geoconnex.us is about publishing water data on the web in a manner similar to the way commercial entities publish information such that it is easily discoverable and useable by software developers to create feature-rich user experiences and information products. \n",
    "\n",
    "Think about the way that a search for a movie title on a search engine instantly brings up a card showing that film's director, cast, showtimes at nearby movie theaters or availability on variou streaming platforms. Or how you can search along in a maps application for gas stations or fast-food chains along your route. Or how a search for a city name and \"population\" might bring up an interactive line graph showing its population trend along with those of other cities. [These sorts of things](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/advanced/structured-data/search-gallery), as well as [generally improved search results](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_engine_optimization), are generally made possible due to the publishing of \"structured, linked data\" within websites.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is structured, linked data?\n",
    "Structured data consists of specifically formatted, machine-readable descriptive information about the subject of the website, as well as in many cases, links to other websites. For example, a webpage about a particular job posting on a job listing app might have structured information about the job title, work location, posting date, salary range, as well as link to the company homepage."
