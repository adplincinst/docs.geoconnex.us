# Using a custom solution for publishing your data

For organizations with pre-existing landing pages for their data, it may be more convenient to add JSON-LD to their existing endpoints without spinning up pygeoapi or additional software infrastructure. This solution is particularly flexible. As long as you expose the JSON-LD and the associated landing pages properly, you can use any software infrastructure you like.


:::note

If you have limited resources or expect a future change in your data formatting or technical infrastructure, pygeoapi is likely to be more maintainable long term
