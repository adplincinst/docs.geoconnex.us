# Exposting your data as JSON-LD 

Geoconnex can crawl data from any url with a valid HTML landing page and data output as JSON-LD in the header tag. You can create a custom solution for your data yourself or you can use pygeoapi, a free open-source tool, for the extract-transform-load (ETL) process to create a wrapper over your data and fulfill these requirements.




import DocCardList from '@theme/DocCardList';

You have two main options for how to expose your data depending on your organization's technical capacity.

<DocCardList />

Once you are finished, you should have a JSON-LD document in the head of your HTML page, analogous to the following example:

:::note

For a more detailed description of the JSON-LD output expected by Geoconnex, see [the JSON-LD reference section](../../reference/data-formats/jsonld/overview.md).
