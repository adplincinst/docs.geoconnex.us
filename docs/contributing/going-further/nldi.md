# Contributing to the Network-Linked Data Index

We encourage those contributing data to the geoconnex.us knowledge graph to also consider contributing to the Hydro Network-Linked Data Index (NLDI), an open-source, USGS-hosted web service allowing data users to discover features of interest from contributed datasets based on "hydrologic" search (e.g. finding those features up/downstream mainstem rivers and tributaries from an arbitrary start point). Learn more about the NLDI [here](https://labs.waterdata.usgs.gov/docs/nldi/about-nldi/index.html).
