# Overview for Accessing Data in Geoconnex

The endpoint at which users can make knowledge graph queries for Geoconnex data is [graph.geoconnex.us](https://graph.geoconnex.us/).
The features registered in https://github.com/internetofwater/geoconnex.us are automatically harvested and included in [graph.geoconnex.us](https://graph.geoconnex.us). These include both community reference features as well as those which are associated with a particular organization or database.

The query functionality for Geoconnex is in active development and there are plans to eventually develop a general purpose web api for accessing the knowledge graph without needing a graph database query language like Sparql.
