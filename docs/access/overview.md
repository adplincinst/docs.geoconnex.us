# Overview for Accessing Data in Geoconnex

Users can make knowledge graph queries for Geoconnex data at [graph.geoconnex.us](https://graph.geoconnex.us/).
The features with a namespace in https://github.com/internetofwater/geoconnex.us are harvested and included in the Geoconnex knowledge graph. These include both community reference features as well as those which are associated with a particular organization or database.

The query functionality for Geoconnex is in active development and there are plans to eventually develop a general purpose web api for accessing the knowledge graph without needing to use a graph database query language like SPARQL.
