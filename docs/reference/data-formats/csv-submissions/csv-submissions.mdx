title: Proper CSV Formatting for Geoconnex

---


:::note

For a tutorial on how to submit your CSV data see [the contribution tutorial](../../../contributing/step-3/minting.md)

:::

Geoconnex expects a standard format for the CSVs which maps a persistent identifier in Geoconnex to one of your resources. You must include at least the following 4 columns:

| Column Title | Description                                                                 |
|--------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `id`        | The ID within geoconnex that your data should map to.                      |
| `target`    | The endpoint where the JSON-LD for the resource can be found.              |
| `creator`   | The contact email associated with the resource.                             |
| `description` | A natural language description of the data.                                |

An example 1:1 mapping can be found [here](https://github.com/internetofwater/geoconnex.us/blob/master/namespaces/usgs/monitoring-location/monitoring-location.csv).

## Regex Mappings

An example 1:N mapping that uses regexes can be found [here](https://github.com/internetofwater/geoconnex.us/blob/master/namespaces/SELFIE/SELFIE_ids.csv)

For more information submitting regular expression redirects and when they are used, see [the tutorial for minting persistent identifiers](/contributing/step-3/minting#adding-regular-expression-redirects-to-geoconnexus)

:::note

Unless you have more than 300,000 features and cannot use 1:1 redirects, you should avoid using regex redirects as they are harder to resolve and maintain
