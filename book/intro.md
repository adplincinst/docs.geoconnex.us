## About the project

The Geoconnex project is about providing technical infrastructure and guidance to create an open, community-contribution model for a knowledge graph linking hydrologic features in the United States, published in accordance with [Spatial Data on the Web best practices](https://www.w3.org/TR/sdw-bp/) as an implementation of [Internet of Water](https://github.com/opengeospatial/SELFIE/blob/master/docs/demo/internet_of_water.md) principles.

In short, Geoconnex aims to make water data as easily discoverable, accessible, and usable as possible.

## What is Geoconnex?

Geoconnex aims to enable a [knowledge graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge_graph) for water data in the United States. The value of this graph, (see `https://graph.geoconnex.us`) can be illustrated considering two use cases:

1. Indexing and discovering models and research from public sector, private sector, or academic projects about a particular place or environmental feature.  
2. Building a federated multi-organization monitoring network in which all member-systems reference common monitored features and are discoverable through a community index.

See [https://geoconnex.us/demo](https://geoconnex.us/demo) for a mockup of data discovery and access workflows that `https://geoconnex.us` aspires to enable.
