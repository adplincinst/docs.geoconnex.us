# Contributing to the geoconnex.us knowledge graph

At a very high level, contributing to the geoconnex.us knowledge graph involves three steps:

1. Publishing landing pages about each real-world feature of interest you have data about.
2. Embedding structured, linked data  with rich descriptive information about the feature formatted as JSON-LD within each landing page
3. Minting persistent identifiers with the [geoconnex.us GitHub repository](https://github.com/internetofwater/geoconnex.us)

Additionally, we encourage those contributing data to the geoconnex.us knowledge graph to also consider contributing to the Network-Linked Data Index (NLDI), an open-source, USGS-hosted web service allowing data users to discover features of interest from contributed datasets based on "hydrologic" search (e.g. finding those features up/downstream mainstem rivers and tributaries from an arbitrary start point). Learn more about the NLDI [here](https://labs.waterdata.usgs.gov/about-nldi/index.html). 

The other documents in this section of the guidebook provide detailed technical references to assist data publishers with understanding each of the above four contribution elements. In addition, we offer a "[Quickstart](https://docs.geoconnex.us/quickstart/intro.html)" showing how to deploy purpose-built open-source software on a public cloud provider to quickly accomplish steps 1-3.
