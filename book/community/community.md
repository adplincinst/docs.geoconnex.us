# Community

The geoconnex.us project is imagined to be a community open-source project with both code and data contributions from a wide variety of entities with interests in the water sector, including: 

 * federal, state, and local government agencies
 * academic institutions and consortia
 * nongovernmental organizations
 * private sector organizations
 * interested individuals



## Operator

The geoconnex.us infrastructure and development pipeline is administered by the [Center for Geospatial Solutions (CGS)](http://cgs.earth) at the [Lincoln Institute of Land Policy (LILP)](https://lincolninst.edu). LILP is a 501(c)3 nonprofit operating foundation dedicated to efforts to "improve quality of life through the effective use, taxation, and stewardship of land". CGS is a center at LILP dedicated to helping organizations leverage geospatial technology and data for such efforts through research, tool development, and technical assistance.

## Developers

geoconnex.us is based on a variety of open-source software as well as open community standards in the geospatial and earth and water science sectors, and all development is managed in public [GitHub repositories](https://github.com/internetofwater/about.geoconnex.us) open to community contributions. However, staff at CGS and the [United States Geological Survey (USGS)](https://geoconnex.us) lead development on technology and documentation specific for the project. The USGS supports development via cooperative agreement under Grant Nos. G21AP10607 and G21AC10732.
